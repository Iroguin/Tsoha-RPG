# Very Simple Role Playing Game
## Introduction

### Game Summary
The game is a turn based Role Playing Game (RPG) with a simple story. The player is in control of a party of heroes tasked with defeating a great evil. The game focuses on strategy and stat based fighting mechanics. This is so the final completed project makes extensive use of SQL tables and the material the course teaches.

### Player experience
The game is a turn based strategy game where different actions (and items in the future) can be used by characters on every turn to fight and exploit the weaknesses of different enemy types. Stat sheets and calculating the benefits of different actions should be the decider of winning tough battles.

## State of Development
New text. Add in a followup commit.

I am planning on continuing working on this project after this course and iterating on it further.

## Trying it Out
New text. Add in a followup commit.

## Appendix

### Gameplay overview
The understanding of the underlying mechanics of the game and strategizing in fights is the main draw of the game. The game won't have much exploration and its design is to be mostly linear to keep the design simple. The player progresses through the game by fighting stronger and stronger enemies while gaining power before fighting the final boss.

### Primary mechanics
There is a main party of four characters with each having their own strengths, weaknesses and abilities. These will be represented in their stat sheets which can change depending on the equipment and items the characters are equipped with.

### Art
Though not implemented yet the artstyle of the game will be simple pixel art. For one to emulate the games it is inspired by and also because of the limited time and resources for making it.

### UI
The ui is mostly text based. a command in the command box like attack opens options for attacks and then selecting one of those execcutes it etc.
