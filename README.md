# Game Name (TBD)
## Introduction
### Game Summary
The game is a turn based Role Playing Game (RPG) with a simple story. The player will be in control of a party of heroes tasked with defeating a great evil. The game will focus on fighting mechanics and understading stat sheets and strategy. This is so the final completed project will make extensive use of SQL tables and the material the course will teach.

	
### Inspiration
 - Final Fantasy
 - Darkest dungeon
 - Pokemon


### Player experience
The game will be a turn based strategy game where actions and items can be used by characters on every turn to fight and exploit the weaknesses of different enemy types. Stat sheets and calculating the benefits of different actions should be the decider of winning tough battles.

	
### Development software
The game will be made with Python and SQL as the main tools. The sprites will be drawn using krita most likely. SQL will be used to manage the stat tables and interactions of those tables during fights. Python will be used for the rest of the game functions.

## Concept
### Gameplay overview
As stated before, the understanding of the underlying mechanics of the game and careful strategizing in fights is the main draw of the game. The game won't have much exploration and its design is to be mostly linear to keep the design simple. The player will progress through the game by fighting stronger and stronger enemies while gaining power before fighting the final boss. 

### Primary mechanics
There will be a main party of characters most likely 4 or so with each having their own strengths and weaknesses. These abilities will be represented in their stat sheets which can change depending on the equipment and items the characters are equipped with.

### Secondary mechanics
TBD

## Art
### Design
The artstyle of the game will be simple pixel art. For one to emulate the games it is inspired by and also because of the limited time and resources for making it. 
	
### Audio
I am as of this moment unsure of the extent that audio production will go so aside from some simple music and fighting sound effects the rest is to be decided.
